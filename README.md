# InsuranceWomen Parental Leave Survey Results

Welcome to the InsuranceWomen Parental Leave Study. This
resource features **user-submitted** data on parental leave policies
from companies in the insurance industry around the world.

Applying or interviewing for a new job can be challenging,
especially if you're planning to start or grow a family. Many
individuals are hesitant to ask about parental leave policies during
the hiring process, as there's often a concern that employers may be
reluctant to hire those who might take leave in the near future
(despite this being illegal and just a bit of a dick move generally!).

To help address this, I've created a survey that gathers user data
(such as gender, country, and type of company) alongside detailed
policy information (including the length of leave, pay, and other
benefits). The results are made available in a searchable table,
allowing you to filter by country, company, and various other
factors to find the information you need.

I hope this study will serve as a living document that will be
continually updated as policies change. If your company is not
listed, please click the link below to take the survey! After you've
completed it, please forward the link to your insurance industry
pals.

> I am happy to work with companies to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date. If you're a company representative and would like to provide information about your parental leave policy, please reach out to me on Instagram. Please note that I will require evidence of the policy in order to mark it as verified.
